# platform-developer-docs-redirect

This repo makes use of the [s2i-caddy-nodejs](https://github.com/bcgov/s2i-caddy-nodejs).

It overrides that repos assemble file so that it only includes a Caddyfile.

The Caddyfile contains redirects for the [platform-developer-docs](https://github.com/bcgov/platform-developer-docs) new location.
